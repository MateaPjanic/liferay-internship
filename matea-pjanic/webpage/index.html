      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Collecting vintage camera is a fun way to gain knowledge about history and photography. While people are upgrading to digital, 35mm film cameras are not old enough to be considered antique. In fact, it is still being used by some professional wedding and portrait photographers. One of the main reason most people buy used cameras is because they are substantially cheaper than the newer models. You will want to focus on SLR and Rangefinder cameras from any era before the early 1990s because they are well-built and sturdy. Major brands like Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Konica and Yashica are outstanding choices as many online buyers still exist, and you can almost be assured of a quality product. Understanding the process of buying is important if you know how.</p>
